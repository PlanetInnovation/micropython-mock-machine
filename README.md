# mock_classes

A MicroPython library designed to mock machine classes for use in unit tests

mock_machine.py is to allow testing of of drivers without relying on actual hardware; the mock classes
can be configured to respond in a predictable way.

currently mock_machine implements:

- MockI2C
    - __init__
    - readfrom_mem
- MockSPI
    - __init__
    - read
- MockPIN
    - __init__
    - init
    - value
    - on
    - off
    - irq
    - mode
    - __call__
- MockADC
    - __init__
    - read_u16

in /examples there are drivers that are unit tested using MockI2C, MockSPI, and MockPIN
